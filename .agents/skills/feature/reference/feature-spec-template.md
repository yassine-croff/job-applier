# Feature: <name>

**From build-plan:** feature <n>
**Build attempt:** <positive integer, starting at 1>
**Status:** not started
**Branch:** `feature/<name>`

## Goal

What this feature delivers, in a sentence or two. Why it matters.

## Design reference

For a visual or replication feature (recreating a design, matching a mockup),
link the reference image(s) here, stored in `blueprint/reference/`. A screenshot
pins down what prose can't, so build against it, not a guess. Omit this section
when the feature has no visual target.

## In scope

- The specific things this feature includes.

## Out of scope

- What it deliberately doesn't touch (deferred to a later feature).

## Build loop

Build one small step at a time. Follow `workflow.stepReview` in
`blueprint/config.json`: `feature` produces one review packet after all steps,
while `every` pauses for review after each step. Offer checkpoint commits only
when `workflow.checkpointCommits` is enabled. `/complete` makes the final feature
commit. Never accept a review packet you have not read; split any diff that is
too large to review.

## Build steps

Small, reviewable units. Each ends with something working. `/implement` checks
these off as it finishes them, so progress survives a context clear: a fresh
session reads which boxes are ticked and resumes from the first unchecked step.

- [ ] **Step 1 - <step>** - what you build. *Done when:* <observable criteria>.
- [ ] **Step 2 - <step>** - what you build. *Done when:* <observable criteria>.

## Files / areas

- The files or modules this will create or change.

## Data / contracts

- Schema, types, or API shapes involved, or "none yet."
- For established persisted-data or external API boundaries, record only the
  material type, format, generation source, uniqueness, default, lifecycle, and
  error behavior that implementation or later features must preserve.
- For established security, tenant, concurrency, destructive-operation, payment,
  or sensitive-data boundaries, record the trusted actor source,
  repository-first tenant scope, atomicity, idempotency, and redaction rules
  that apply.
- Do not create contracts or machinery for hypothetical future boundaries.

## Testing

- How to verify: what to click through, and the observable done-when per step.
- If a test runner is configured, name the in-scope logic that needs a test
  (parsers, formatters, validators, server actions - not components or
  integration/render routes), so each logic-bearing step ships its test. If no
  runner is configured, say so and rely on screenshot plus build evidence. See the
  Testing gate in `coding-standards.md`.

## Notes for the AI

- Conventions and constraints to respect (e.g. client vs server, filter user-scoped queries by the authenticated user's id, match an existing data shape).
