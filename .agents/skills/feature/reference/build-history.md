# Build history identity

Read metadata from the archived original spec, not appended findings or review.
Read the feature ID from its `**From build-plan:**` or supported legacy
feature field, not its title or filename. Normalize the numeric part by removing
leading zeros and the optional letter to lowercase (`012A` becomes `12a`). Match
that complete ID, never a substring. Use the archived spec's positive integer
`**Build attempt:**`; duplicate or malformed fields stop selection. A legacy
first-build archive without it counts as attempt 1 only when its spec identity
and unsuffixed `NN-name.md` path agree unambiguously. Derive the expected name
from its own spec, not today's renamed plan title. Text such as `Build 2` in a
title proves no attempt.
For new paths, pad the numeric part to at least two digits, keep its letter, and
use the spec title's lowercase kebab-case slug. Append `--build-N` only for N > 1.
An archive declaring an attempt must agree with that computed path.
The double hyphen is reserved: slug normalization collapses punctuation runs to
one hyphen, so a first build titled `Export Build 2` uses `04-export-build-2.md`,
while a later attempt 2 titled `Export` uses `04-export--build-2.md`.

Before freezing a new spec, check its exact planned archive path and branch.
Require `lstat` to return `ENOENT` for the archive leaf; any existing entry,
including a dangling symlink, blocks it. Present parents must be ordinary
directories. Require a valid branch name and no existing or namespace-conflicting
local branch ref (inspect `git for-each-ref refs/heads/`, including packed refs).
Also require no prior use of the archive path in available Git history:

```bash
git log --all --reflog --full-history --format=%H -- <planned-archive-path>
```

Any result or inspection failure stops before spec review with the exact collision.
Do not auto-bump the attempt or rename reviewed work to avoid it. These checks
apply to new specs; existing completion must run its recovery routing first so
its own archive is reconciled rather than rejected. Preserve already-reviewed
legacy spec bytes, branch, and any proven recovery destination.

A legacy rebuild can preserve a reviewed spec without this field. Its completion
annotation must freeze the original `baseCommit`: resolve only prior builds and
their completed reversals present at that base, derive `max(attempts) + 1`, and
require the exact resulting archive path. For an integrated archive, its unique
introducing commit's sole parent must equal that base. For unfinished completion,
use Complete's phase proof. The path checks this derived attempt; it never supplies
the number. Missing or ambiguous proof stops without rewriting the archived spec.
Settled history numbering and rollback selection do not require the annotation's
historical `head` or `sourceTree`; actual completion recovery still requires them.

Before using prior builds or reversals, prove each selected record on the local
default branch. Resolve the unique introducing commit with:

```bash
git log --full-history --diff-filter=A --format=%H <local-default> -- <archive-path>
git log --full-history --format=%H <introducing-commit>..<local-default> -- <archive-path>
```

The first result must contain exactly one commit which actually adds the path;
the second must be empty. Confirm the current blob and mode equal that addition
(use Git's normal EOL normalization for a working-file comparison). Inspect the
record at that commit, not an uncommitted replacement. Reject orphan, overwritten,
deleted/re-added, renamed, multiply-added, or conflicting records. Never choose
the newest commit, file count, or timestamp to resolve ambiguity.

A build is reversed only by a completed `**Type:** Rollback` record with its exact
`**Target archive:**` and full `**Target commit:**`, matching feature ID, verified
or complete status and finished steps. Its `Target parent` must match the target's
sole parent. Prove that rollback record's unique unchanged addition
by the same procedure, reachable on the local default after the target build.
Require a non-merge rollback commit containing that record and its completed
plan bookkeeping. Uncommitted, malformed, changed, or merely rollback-looking
files are not completed reversals. Conflicting or duplicate reversals stop.

Include exact rollback references retained on the selected plan line; missing
referenced records are a blocker, not an empty history. For a new unchecked feature,
use 1 when there are no prior records; otherwise
require every prior build to have one proven completed reversal and allocate
`max(attempts) + 1`. Duplicate attempts or inconsistent/missing history stop with
the exact paths and missing proof. Search only this feature's records and their
exact reversal references. Ignored local-only history without introducing-commit
proof cannot establish a rebuild or rollback target; stop without force-adding or
migrating it. Ordinary first builds do not require prior history.
