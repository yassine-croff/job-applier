# status - where the project stands right now

**Context reuse:** Reuse any required file already loaded in project instructions or the current session. Read it again only if absent, changed, or exact current bytes or line references are needed.

Where this sits in the workflow:

    any time  ->  [status]  ->  reads build-plan + current-feature + git
                  (read-only)   prints a short "you are here"

This skill answers one question: *where am I?* It reads the files that already
track progress and prints a short orientation. It is the fast way back in after a
break, a context clear, or a day away. It never changes anything: no edits, no
commits, no installs, no builds, no branch changes.

Progress in this workflow lives in files, not the chat, so everything this skill
reports comes from disk and git. That is the point: a fresh session can run
`/status` and know exactly as much as the last one did.

For setup problems, missing files, placeholder plans, adapter drift, or questions
about whether the Blueprint is installed correctly, run `/doctor` instead.

## Input

None. `/status` takes no argument.

## What it reads

Gather these, then summarize. Don't dump file contents; report the distilled
state.

1. **Project configuration** - read `blueprint/config.json` when present. Report
   `project settings`, `built-in defaults`, or `invalid, using defaults`. A
   missing file is healthy and means defaults. Invalid JSON, schema versions,
   keys, values, non-file paths, or symbolic links are a warning and make
   `/doctor` the next action before any mutating workflow command. Report the
   effective regular and Continuous audit, independent-review, check, and
   try-guide policies, plus `review.independentExecution`. Explain that
   independent review defaults to `when-sensitive` for both workflows and
   execution defaults to `automatic`, which uses an isolated reviewer only when
   the current adapter supports it. Audit, check, and try guide default to
   `manual`.
   Before recommending `/overview`, check whether `AGENTS.md` still contains
   the shipped `For a standard Next.js project` command marker. When it does,
   onboarding is incomplete and `/onboard` is the next action.
2. **Build plan** - `blueprint/build-plan.md`. Count checked vs unchecked leaf
   items. Name the next unchecked leaf, the same target `/feature` would pick,
   and note if a parent item was split into sub-items (`4a`, `4b`, ...).
3. **Current work** - `blueprint/context/current-feature.md`. Is something in
   progress, or is it the reset stub? If a feature, fix, or rollback spec is
   present, report its type and name, which build steps are checked, and the
   first unchecked step where `/implement` resumes.
4. **Findings** - `blueprint/context/findings.md`. Count findings by status and
   report open and fixed counts next to build-plan progress. Call out any P0 or
   P1 still `open` or `fixed` by ID, since those block `/complete`. A missing
   file means no findings.
5. **Independent review** - `blueprint/context/review.md`. Report none, pending,
   changes-requested, passed, malformed, or stale. For an active record, name
   the requested or actual reviewer adapter and model. A selected or explicitly
   initiated independent review blocks `/complete` until a passing receipt
   matches the exact current checkpoint and spec.
6. **Overview freshness** - if `blueprint/context/project-overview.md` is missing
   or has no `blueprint:source-hash`, mention that `/overview` should run before
   new feature work. Otherwise use `/overview`'s hash contract: exact project-plan
   bytes, one zero byte, then build-plan bytes with line-start `- [x]` and
   `- [X]` markers normalized to `- [ ]`. Treat a matching legacy exact-byte hash
   as current for backward compatibility. Recommend `/overview` only when the
   recorded hash matches neither value. Do not use filesystem timestamps;
   `/complete` legitimately makes `build-plan.md` newer when it checks off work.
7. **Git** - current branch, whether the working tree is clean or has uncommitted
   changes, roughly how many files changed, last commit subject, and whether the
   branch is ahead of its remote. If the directory is not a git repo, say so and
   skip this part rather than failing.
8. **Progress drift** - flag active spec on `main`, a spec in progress but no
   branch matching the configured feature, fix, or rollback prefix, all spec steps checked but
   not completed, or disagreement between `build-plan.md` and
   `current-feature.md`. A rollback legitimately targets a checked build-plan
   item until `/complete` unchecks it, so do not compare it to the next unchecked
   feature.
9. **Dashboard activity** - read `blueprint/.state/run.json` when it exists.
   Report the command, mode, status, progress, boundary, and safe resume command.
   A missing file simply means no activity has been recorded. Invalid activity
   state is a warning, not a blocker for the underlying workflow; point to
   `/doctor` to inspect and offer the approved generated-state reset.

Before choosing the next action, use the read-only candidate screen in the
installed Complete skill (`../complete/reference/completion-recovery.md`). Inspect
branch, working-tree changes, live state, relevant archives, and matching local
work refs. Route a completion candidate to `/complete` for full phase proof; do
not write Git objects or claim recovery has been verified from Status. On a clean
local default branch with consistent live state and no matching work ref or
pending completion evidence, the archive is settled history. Continue normal
routing without requiring historical transient objects lost in a clone or prune.
A reset stub alone does not establish this state. Actual candidates with missing
or conflicting evidence need identification/repair before new work.

## Output

A short, scannable summary, not a wall of text. Aim for something like:

    Status: Building feature 4 - PDF export
    Config: Project settings.
    Review execution: automatic.
    Gates: regular audit manual, independent review when-sensitive, check when-behavioral, try guide manual;
           Continuous audit always, independent review manual, check always, try guide when-user-facing.
    Plans: Overview current. Build plan 3 of 9 complete.
    Current work: Step 2 of 3 done. Next step: Download PDF button.
    Activity: /autopilot ready, 3/3 build steps, reviewed boundary.
    Findings: 1 open P2 (F-04), 1 fixed P1 awaiting re-review (F-02).
    Review: pending for Claude Code with the selected model.
    Git: branch feature/pdf-export, 3 uncommitted files, last commit "feat: widen export helper".
    Watch: F-02 is fixed but not re-reviewed; it blocks /complete until /audit closes it.

    Next action: run /implement for Step 3.

End with a single suggested next action, chosen in this order:

- The project configuration is invalid -> `/doctor`.
- A completion candidate has conflicting or ambiguous evidence -> identify the
  exact missing archive, branch, or commit evidence before new work.
- Pending completion candidate -> `/complete` to prove and resume its phase.
- Dashboard activity is malformed -> `/doctor`.
- The overview is missing or stale and no feature is in progress -> `/overview`.
- A spec is in progress with unchecked steps -> `/implement` and name the step.
- A spec is in progress and all implementation steps are checked -> `/check` if
  proof is not recorded, `/check guide` if the user wants a manual review path,
  `/implement` when a P0 or P1 finding is still `open` (the repair is an extra
  reviewed step), `/audit` when one is `fixed` and awaiting re-review (both
  block `/complete`), `/audit independent current` when independent review is
  required, pending, changes-requested, or stale, otherwise `/complete`.
- `current-feature.md` is the reset stub and a P0 or P1 finding is `open` ->
  `/fix <finding id>`; when one is `fixed`, `/audit` to re-review and close it.
- `current-feature.md` is the reset stub and unchecked build-plan items remain ->
  `/feature` and name the next build-plan item.
- All build-plan items are checked -> say the current milestone is complete;
  suggest hardening, release, or docs when appropriate, or
  `/feature "new capability"` to propose an addition to the living build plan.
  Do not suggest creating a second build plan.

If something is off, include a `Watch:` line before the next action. Catching
drift is half the value of the command.

## Rules

- **Read-only, always.** This skill never writes a file, never commits, never runs
  installs, never runs builds or tests, and never switches branches. If the user
  wants to act on what it reports, they run the relevant skill next.
- **Prefer exact next actions.** Do not end with vague advice like "continue the
  workflow". Name the command and, when useful, the file or step.
- **Distill, don't dump.** Report the state in a few lines. Do not paste file
  contents back unless the user asks for them.
- **Be honest about gaps.** If a file is missing or the repo is not initialized,
  say that plainly instead of guessing.

## Formatting

Format the output to match the project's conventions in
`blueprint/context/ai-interaction.md`: concise, scannable markdown, with lists for
enumerations and tables for matrices rather than dense paragraphs.
