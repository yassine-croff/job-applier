> <one-line description of the project>

## Problem

The problem this solves, distilled from project-plan.md section 1. Two or three
sentences: what's broken today and why it matters.

## Users

Who this is for, from project-plan.md section 2. A short list of user types and
what each one needs. Note any access tiers (e.g. anonymous vs signed-in).

## Usage model

Confirmed scale, reachability, trust, tenancy, security, compliance,
availability, audit constraints, and explicit non-requirements from
the usage-model section (section 9 in the shipped worksheet), when present. Omit
this section when the plan establishes none of these facts. Never turn worksheet
prompts or blank fields into requirements.

## Features

The MVP feature set, in build-plan.md order - one line of purpose each. This is
the map of what exists and what's coming, not the detailed spec (that's
/feature's job). Flag the headline feature.

1. **<feature>** - what it delivers.
2. **<feature>** - what it delivers.

## Data model

The concrete shape of stored data, derived from project-plan.md section 4 and the
features that use it. Real models with fields, types, and relationships - not a
vague list.

### <Model>

- `field` (type) - what it is
- relationship to <other model>

> Lock shapes that later features depend on, and say so.

## Tech stack

The stack from project-plan.md section 5, one line each on what it's for.

- **<tech>** - role in the project

## Monetization

How it makes money, or "not in v1," from project-plan.md section 6.

## UI/UX

Look, feel, and the main routes/screens, from project-plan.md section 7.

- `/<route>` - what's there

## Deployment

Target host, app type, build/start commands, output directory, env vars by name,
database/storage needs, workers or cron jobs, health path, and domain notes from
project-plan.md section 8.

> TODO if the deployment target is not decided yet.

## Open questions

> TODOs and contradictions found between the two plans. Resolve them in the
> plans, then re-run /overview. Delete this section when empty.
